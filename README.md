Automatically makes a bare-bones Flask virtual environment thats programming ready from the start.

requirements:
-python3 
-pip3

You can install these with the script as well just uncomment: 
-brew install python3
-brew install pip3

#change brew to apt-get if you are not a mac user.

How it works:

It sets up a virtual environment in a Flask folder, then it installs the virualenv and activates it.
No more hassles.

run the bash script: ./flash-env.sh
